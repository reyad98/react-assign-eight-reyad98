# Welcome to Billionaire Club

This project was made with [Billionaire Club](https://eager-noether-4f6d10.netlify.app/).

## Take your time

 You can run and add what you want

### `Can You Join?`

If you are rich enough to join, then you don't have to pay to be a member. Last year there were a total of 2,825 billionaires in the world, according to market research firm Wealth-X, the highest number ever.So,you are welcome in our club

### `Meet with Billionaires`

If you are rich enough to join, then you don't have to pay to be a member. That is the central idea behind what might be dubbed “the billionaire’s club,” a series of conferences for family offices and ultra-high net worth individuals that has been running for a decade.

### `Story with glory`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
